## DATE:27-04-25
## AIM:
To write a C program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression

## Algorithm
1. Start
2. Input the postfix expression
3. Traverse each character of the expression
4. Determine the priority of the operator
5. Classify and Display the priority
6. Repeat Steps 3â€“5 for all characters in the expression
7.End 

## Program:
```
/*
Program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression
Developed by: 
RegisterNumber:

```

## Output:



## Result:
Thus the C program to find and display the priority of the operator in the given Postfix expression is implemented successfully
